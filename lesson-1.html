    <p>This page is meant to be read in the code itself, viewed side-by-side with the page in the browser!</p>

    <!-- <h1>Hello World!!</h1> -->

    

    <h1>This is a header! The biggest one, in fact!</h1>
    <h2>This one is slightly smaller!</h2>
    <h3>And another, even smaller than the last!</h3>
    <h4>There are SIX of these headers, you can probably guess the name of the last two....</h4>

    <p>This is a paragraph element! These are sortof the generic text elements. You will want to use these for most text that isn't a header or something fancy like that.</p>

    <p>
        See how annoying that long paragraph element is? Code usually doesn't "word-wrap" in code editors,
        but you can adjust that in the settings. I prefer to do this though, because HTML doesn't care
        about line breaks in our code, it only cares about the linebreaks we specifically tell it to do!
        So this formatting won't be visible to the user, but it makes our code easier to read. You can do
        word-wrap in your code editor's settings though, it doesn't matter, it's up to you!

        See where I placed the p tag on this element and the above element? HTML doesn't care about
        whitespace like line breaks and indents! For elements with a lot of content, it can be easier to 
        read the paragraph without the annoying HTML tags cluttering everything up.
        <br>
        THIS is a line break, and that will create a line of nothingness to separate stuff out. You can also use it outside of the p element, like this:

        Some other cool HTML elements to know about are <strong>the strong element, which bolds the text.</strong> <em>The emphasis element, which italicizes the text.</em>
        There are two elements that do this exact same thing, <b>for bold text</b> and <i>for italicized text.</i> What's the difference?
        <br>
        strong and em carry meaning beyong just the appearance of the text. Screen readers used by blind people will take this into account, and the electronic voice will 
        read it like a human would! Pretty cool! 
        <br>
        It's pretty rare that you would want to bold text but not let blind people know about it, so you should usually use strong and em. The i element is often used for 
        font icons, like those from font-awesome.

        You've heard of "links" AKA "hyperlinks" on the internet. Well, here's how you make them! You use an "anchor" element,
        like this: <a href="google.com">Click here to go to Google.com!</a> 
    </p>


    <p>
        This is an img element, an IMAGE element (I bet you never would've guessed..) the src is the location of the image,
        which is either another place on the internet or a place on your web server. The alt is text that describes the image.
        This text is used to describe to blind people what the picture contains, so you want to be very literal with your alt text.

    <img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/548467d8-c5f1-4551-9f58-6817a8d2c45e/NationalGeographic_2572187_square.jpg" 
         alt="picture of white and light-grey cat with large blue eyes and a pink nose"
         width="500">
    <p>
        img tags are "self closing", because they don't have any content inside of the tag, like a p element does.
    </p>


    <p>
        The last thing I'll show you in this lesson is <span>the span element!</span> This element is cool
        because it doesn't disrupt the flow of the text! You can use this to do all sorts of cool things, but it doesn't do anything on its own.

    <p>
        So this is all great and all, but look at this garbage! This website looks AWFUL!!!!!
